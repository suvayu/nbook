* About =nbook=
This program serves as an address book based on notmuch queries.

=nbook= allows the user to query a notmuch database for email
addresses.  It looks in the ~to:~, ~from:~ and ~cc:~ headers of the
email messages for matches.  Unique matching email addresses are
printed on the terminal.  The purpose of the program is to serve as a
search based address book.  It is designed to replicate the abook
program, for use with text based email clients like mutt.

The underlying idea to use search queries as an address book was
inspired by /Gmail/.  The idea to use email indexers (like =notmuch=)
to extract the email addresses was conceived by Dirk-Jan C. Binnema,
author of =mu= (a notmuch inspired email indexer) and =mu4e= (an Emacs
based email client for mu).  Since the inspiration was the /Gmail/
interface, the name and email matching is done case-insensitively.

I hope you enjoy this little utility.

* Usage with Mutt
: set query_command = "nbook '%s'"

* Note
=nbook= requires _Python 2.7 or higher_ as it depends on the
=argparse= module for option parsing.

* Issues
There performance issues for large email indexes.  There are plans to
implement a cacheing database in the future.

* Alternatives
When I wrote this I was unaware there were similar (much smarter)
utilities already out there.  You can find more information in [[http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.mail.notmuch.general/12452][this
thread]].
